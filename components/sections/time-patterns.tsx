          Traffic congestion isn't staticâ€”it ebbs and flows throughout the day, week, and year. Understanding these
          temporal patterns is crucial for both commuters planning their trips and transportation agencies designing
          mitigation strategies.

              Temporal data would reveal how congestion builds during morning rush hours (typically 7-9 AM), decreases
              during midday, and peaks again during evening commutes (4-6 PM). This information helps commuters plan
              optimal travel times and assists transportation agencies in managing traffic flow during peak periods.
